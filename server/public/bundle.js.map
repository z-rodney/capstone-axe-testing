{Object} [options.mapboxgl] A [mapbox-gl](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js) instance to use when creating [Markers](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#marker). Required if `options.marker` is `true`.\n * @param {Number} [options.zoom=16] On geocoded result what zoom level should the map animate to when a `bbox` isn't found in the response. If a `bbox` is found the map will fit to the `bbox`.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.flyTo=true] If `false`, animating the map to a selected result is disabled. If `true`, animating the map will use the default animation parameters. If an object, it will be passed as `options` to the map [`flyTo`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#flyto) or [`fitBounds`](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#map#fitbounds) method providing control over the animation of the transition.\n * @param {String} [options.placeholder=Search] Override the default placeholder attribute value.\n * @param {Object} [options.proximity] a proximity argument: this is\n * a geographical point given as an object with `latitude` and `longitude`\n * properties. Search results closer to this point will be given\n * higher priority.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.trackProximity=true] If `true`, the geocoder proximity will automatically update based on the map view.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.collapsed=false] If `true`, the geocoder control will collapse until hovered or in focus.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.clearAndBlurOnEsc=false] If `true`, the geocoder control will clear it's contents and blur when user presses the escape key.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.clearOnBlur=false] If `true`, the geocoder control will clear its value when the input blurs.\n * @param {Array} [options.bbox] a bounding box argument: this is\n * a bounding box given as an array in the format `[minX, minY, maxX, maxY]`.\n * Search results will be limited to the bounding box.\n * @param {string} [options.countries] a comma separated list of country codes to\n * limit results to specified country or countries.\n * @param {string} [options.types] a comma seperated list of types that filter\n * results to match those specified. See https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#data-types\n * for available types.\n * If reverseGeocode is enabled, you should specify one type. If you configure more than one type, the first type will be used.\n * @param {Number} [options.minLength=2] Minimum number of characters to enter before results are shown.\n * @param {Number} [options.limit=5] Maximum number of results to show.\n * @param {string} [options.language] Specify the language to use for response text and query result weighting. Options are IETF language tags comprised of a mandatory ISO 639-1 language code and optionally one or more IETF subtags for country or script. More than one value can also be specified, separated by commas. Defaults to the browser's language settings.\n * @param {Function} [options.filter] A function which accepts a Feature in the [Carmen GeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md) format to filter out results from the Geocoding API response before they are included in the suggestions list. Return `true` to keep the item, `false` otherwise.\n * @param {Function} [options.localGeocoder] A function accepting the query string which performs local geocoding to supplement results from the Mapbox Geocoding API. Expected to return an Array of GeoJSON Features in the [Carmen GeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md) format.\n * @param {Function} [options.externalGeocoder] A function accepting the query string and current features list which performs geocoding to supplement results from the Mapbox Geocoding API. Expected to return a Promise which resolves to an Array of GeoJSON Features in the [Carmen GeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md) format.\n * @param {distance|score} [options.reverseMode=distance] - Set the factors that are used to sort nearby results.\n * @param {boolean} [options.reverseGeocode=false] If `true`, enable reverse geocoding mode. In reverse geocoding, search input is expected to be coordinates in the form `lat, lon`, with suggestions being the reverse geocodes.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.enableEventLogging=true] Allow Mapbox to collect anonymous usage statistics from the plugin.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.marker=true]  If `true`, a [Marker](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/#marker) will be added to the map at the location of the user-selected result using a default set of Marker options.  If the value is an object, the marker will be constructed using these options. If `false`, no marker will be added to the map. Requires that `options.mapboxgl` also be set.\n * @param {Function} [options.render] A function that specifies how the results should be rendered in the dropdown menu. This function should accepts a single [Carmen GeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md) object as input and return a string. Any HTML in the returned string will be rendered.\n * @param {Function} [options.getItemValue] A function that specifies how the selected result should be rendered in the search bar. This function should accept a single [Carmen GeoJSON](https://github.com/mapbox/carmen/blob/master/carmen-geojson.md) object as input and return a string. HTML tags in the output string will not be rendered. Defaults to `(item) => item.place_name`.\n * @param {String} [options.mode=mapbox.places] A string specifying the geocoding [endpoint](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/#endpoints) to query. Options are `mapbox.places` and `mapbox.places-permanent`. The `mapbox.places-permanent` mode requires an enterprise license for permanent geocodes.\n * @param {Boolean} [options.localGeocoderOnly=false] If `true`, indicates that the `localGeocoder` results should be the only ones returned to the user. If `false`, indicates that the `localGeocoder` results should be combined with those from the Mapbox API with the `localGeocoder` results ranked higher.\n * @example\n * var geocoder = new MapboxGeocoder({ accessToken: mapboxgl.accessToken });\n * map.addControl(geocoder);\n * @return {MapboxGeocoder} `this`\n *\n */\n\nfunction MapboxGeocoder(options) {\n  this._eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n  this.options = extend({}, this.options, options);\n  this.inputString = '';\n  this.fresh = true;\n  this.lastSelected = null;\n}\n\nMapboxGeocoder.prototype = {\n  options: {\n    zoom: 16,\n    flyTo: true,\n    trackProximity: true,\n    minLength: 2,\n    reverseGeocode: false,\n    limit: 5,\n    origin: 'https://api.mapbox.com',\n    enableEventLogging: true,\n    marker: true,\n    mapboxgl: null,\n    collapsed: false,\n    clearAndBlurOnEsc: false,\n    clearOnBlur: false,\n    getItemValue: function(item) {\n      return item.place_name\n    },\n    render: function(item) {\n      var placeName = item.place_name.split(',');\n      return '<div class=\"mapboxgl-ctrl-geocoder--suggestion\"><div class=\"mapboxgl-ctrl-geocoder--suggestion-title\">' + placeName[0]+ '</div><div class=\"mapboxgl-ctrl-geocoder--suggestion-address\">' + placeName.splice(1, placeName.length).join(',') + '</div></div>';\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Add the geocoder to a container.
